STUFF TO ADD/ ASAP CHANGES (noah's notes)
--------------------------
* Add a way for people to see the public name of the profile/keyword that is not the same
   as the keyword.
* Change the keys database to a more general purpose database (see "datastructures")
* make it posssible to airdrop a message 
* connect website to code
* print map to screen on website via online database, make viewable data
* check voice assistant feasability
* chech PHP connection
* glassCell() master function call

FUNCTIONALITY and ABSTRACTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

DATABASE
--------
Every entry ine database contains the following information:
1. Profile:
   Each profile contains a unqiue "keyword," a "screen name" and a history of signals.
2. Signal(s): (-within profiles, same line)
   Each signal has a chronological index in the profile array. Every signal input includes the date & time
   of the signal, the location, the sequential index of the signal, the healthbar of the signal, 
   and the associted message message.

   DATASTRUCTURES
   --------------
   1. PROFILES: 
      Stored in a CSV file.
      The CSV file can be parsed using delimeters. 
      For computation and processing, every profile is stored as an item in a dictionary.
      The key is the keyword, the value is embedded lists containing signals.
   ************************************************************************************************************
   ********* To use delimeters, we will need to add flags in the CSV to know when one type of data stops ******
   ********* and another starts.                                                                         ******
   ************************************************************************************************************
   2. SIGNALS:
      Each signal is stored as a linked list? or map? of values to retain order.
   3. DATAPOINTS
      Data points are stored in each signal array as comma-separated values.

IN CASE OF GENERIC SIGNALS
---------------------------
* Some signals will be entirely empty, with no existing corresponding profile.
* Others may have some subset of fields empty.

Any of the following cases will be overwritten with a new keyword regardless of three possibilites:
   (case A) -- Signal is from an entirely new user.
   (cases B) -- Signal is from an existing user who mispelled their keyword.
      In this case, the signal is still broadcast, but the user is notified of the unknown keyword
   (case C) -- Signal is from an existing user who did not specify their keyword for some reason.

* In any of those cases:
   EXPLICIT INFORMATION: 
      Keyword: new one is created
      Healthbar: listed as "unspecified"
      Messsage: a generic message, such as "I'm in danger; I need help!!" is set
   IMPLICIT INFORMATION:
      Screen name: randomly generated
      Location: still stored
      Date/time: still stored and set to new Profile
      Chronological index: set to zero, of course.

Futuristic lofty updates:
-------------------
- Use AI to intelligently smerge profiles with differing keywords
- Prevent spam and snooping by convicts
- provide a way to resolve cases

STUFF TO ADD (Dan's notes)
--------------------------
* An easy to access website that features games to act as a disguise.
* Link database to the website so that users can send keywords and save them to the csv file.
* Add map function that Kevin worked on to our website.
